## About
We present the Focused Concept Miner (FCM) Command Line Interface (CLI), an exploratory tool which operationalizes an interpretable, deep learning-based text mining algorithm such that managers and researchers can accessibly analyze high-resolution unstructured data. This is specifically designed to be accessible for managers and researchers with or without a technical background. For more information about FCM CLI, please visit [FCMiner](http://www.fcminer.com/).

In this guide, we provide a step-by-step guide on setup, features, implementation, and troubleshooting of FCM CLI. We also discuss a general approach to explore data and filter results to obtain meaningful insights using FCM's __Grid Search__ and __Visualize__ features.

Becoming comfortable with the features and processes we discuss in the guide will enable you to rapidly extract insights from unstructured data in a fraction of the time that involved, multi-step approaches require. We encourage you to experiment with creative applications to glean insights and develop novel hypotheses from rich unstructured data.

The guide notebook covers the following:

1. Introduction & Caveats
2. Installation
3. Commands & Features
4. Demonstration
5. Closing Comments
